Jobs That Interest You

Designed at 1440 by 900 pixels. This is a website built in React that uses router doms to switch between components. Each component has a job that I believe is interesting and would like to work at.

3/13/24 part 1: Created the files and added the browser router. 3/13/24 part 2: Added the styling and hooked up all of the pages to one another. All that is left is to write out the paragraphs for the jobs themselves. 3/14/24: Added the first job, the following jobs should go by quicker. 3/15/24: Added all of the other jobs. Finished
