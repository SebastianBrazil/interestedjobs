Jobs That Interest You

Designed at 1440 by 900 pixels. This is a website built in React that uses router doms to switch between components. Each component has a job that I believe is interesting and would like to work at.

3/13/24 part 1: Created the files and added the browser router. 3/13/24 part 2: Added the styling and hooked up all of the pages to one another. All that is left is to write out the paragraphs for the jobs themselves. 3/14/24: Added the first job, the following jobs should go by quicker. 3/15/24: Added all of the other jobs. Finished

overall good website it uses the navbar component from boot strap, router dom to navigate pages, and useNavigate to switch between components using button clicks. each page fills the requirements from lms and even contains links for related jab listings. Design wise I like the color choices of blue and a pastel yellow however the white text on top of the wave background might be hard for some people to read. I can read it just fine but the wave has some lighter blues on it. Over good job!
